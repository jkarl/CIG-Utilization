### Project objectives:
The overall goal of this project is to develop and extend a hybrid field and remote sensing system for assessing grazing impacts at ranch or pasture scales. This system will integrate plot-based field utilization and residual biomass measurements with remotely-sensed metrics of vegetation biomass and grazing intensity in an expanded online CERT tool. Our specific objectives are to:
1.  Extend the vegetation mapping previously developed for the Pacific northwest bunchgrass prairie (Zumwalt study area) to five study areas in southern Idaho by developing sagebrush-steppe specific models and mapping products for vegetation biomass and change in biomass.  
2.  Evaluate correspondence of data from the four methods of field-collected utilization data in the Grouse and Grazing study and recommend refinements to improve data quality and location of measurement sites.
3.  Determine which field utilization or residual biomass measurements and remotely-sensed metrics best reflect actual livestock distribution measured via GPS collars and livestock density and stocking rate. 
4.  Through outreach and application with ranchers, refine the existing CERT online information system for analysis and visualization of 1) total vegetation amounts 2) field utilization and residual biomass measurements and 3) remotely-sensed grazing intensity data.
5.  Work with private ranchers in southern Idaho and northeast Oregon to develop and integrate a hybrid field and remote sensing grazing monitoring approach into their ranch-specific adaptive management and planning, and share their experiences with other land managers in these regions.
